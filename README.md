# terminal-ui

A way to build [TUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface) apps with a layout system and API that's similar to SwiftUI.

We reimplemented parts of the SwiftUI layout system in the Swift Talk series [SwiftUI Layout Explained](https://talk.objc.io/collections/swiftui-layout-explained). This tries to stay as close to that as possible.
